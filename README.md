# Tutorial Workbench

A workbench for the upcoming DIKU online tutorials infrastructure.

## Definition

A **tutorial** gives a quick, pedagogically well-structured introduction to the
matter at hand, focusing only on the features important to course content, in a
language close in spirit to a designated group of students.

## Intended Authors

Recent and current TAs are perhaps the ideal tutorial authors, as they
typically are close in spirit to the students. TAs traditionally, have served
to bridge the gap between formal course content and the students. Online
tutorials are intended to incarnate and disseminate this spirit for (at least)
a couple years to come.

## Preliminary Guideline

* Write tutorials so that a student can follow along offline and locally (on
  their own machine), as well as (perhaps) online.
* Cross-reference tutorials for skill-referencing.
* Decorate tutorials with small, testable, inline exercises.
* Write good tests and instructive feedback for the exercises.
* Do not fear the command-line.
* Do not fear domain-specific languages (e.g. for diagramming or pseudocode).
* Do not fear grep'ing and pseudo-parsing students' solutions for testing.
* Take assignments, solutions, and feedback from previous years as (necessarily
  quite representative) data for inspiration for testing and feedback.

## Preliminary Timeline

* 2-4 tutorials ready in time for the APL lunch on Friday, May 29.

## Feature Envy

* Elegant (co-)authoring of tutorials by teachers and TAs.
* Feedback from students on tutorial, exercise, and feedback quality.
* Tutorial series.
* Competing tutorials.
* Tutorial search and discovery.
