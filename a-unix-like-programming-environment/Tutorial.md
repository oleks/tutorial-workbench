# A Unix-like Programming Environment

Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike. _The UNIX Programming Environment_. Prentice
Hall, 1984.

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to a philosophy of using the
computer, perhaps different from what you already are acquainted with.

This philosophy stands on the shoulders of many pioneers of modern operating
systems and programming environments.

The reason that this way of using a computer is often not in wide-spread
adoption is perhaps due to:

1. a general public disinterest in computer programming,
2. a fondness of the general public of [graphical user
interfaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), and
3. the resulting sectaraniasm of those who practice what we preach.

This tutorial is in close spirit with the popular book "The UNIX Programming
Environment", by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike, Prentice Hall, 1984, and
serves perhaps as a modern introduction to the book, should you choose to read
it.

This tutorial is by no means comprehensive, and is not intended as a reference
beyond its philosophical considerations. As part of the tutorial, we will try
to point you to materials for further study.

## The Bits of History

UNIXÂ® is trademark of [The Open Group](http://www.unix.org/what_is_unix.html),
who stand to certify products which conform to their [Single UNIX
Specification](http://www.unix.org/online.html).

Colloquially however, UNIX refers to a family of operating systems developed at
Bell Labs in the 1970s, and their many descendants.

A 1982 Bell Labs video, recently made available under AT&T Archives, gives you
some insight into what the original UNIX systems were like, the philosophy and
history behind them, starring such pioneers as Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie,
and Brian W. Kernighan: <a

An important aspect of the history of UNIX is that it has always been guided by
the needs of its users and programmers.

Later, so-called Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) emerged, the most
popular today being perhaps Eclipse, XCode, and Visual Studio (no marketing
intended).

## Hello, Terminal

The crux of a Unix-like programming environment is a Unix-like command-line
interface with the operating system, often referred to as a "terminal".

The interface interprets a string of characters as a command, and yields a
string of characters as the result of executing the command.

A command-line interface takes text as
input and produces text as output.

> DEFINITION: A "shell" is a user interface for accessing the services offered
> by an operating system.

One of the benefits of dealing with a command-line interface is that it does
not require the use of screenshots to show either sample inputs or outputs of a
computer program.

You are **strongly discouraged** in the use of screenshots for such purposes.
Not least because, as you already have seen, terminals can visually look very
different on different operating systems.

### Mac OS

### Windows

### Other

If you're reading this tutorial on a handheld device, you are out of luck. The
iOS and Android operating systems are too uptight for us to set up an Unix-like
programming environment.

If you're reading this on your personal computer and using something other than
Linux, Mac OS, and Windows, chances are, you are already familiar with a
Unix-like terminal(if not, let us know!), and you can skip directly past the
following section.

## Working with Directories and Files

## Text-editors

## Unix-like Text Processing Utilities

## Automating Your Workflows With Shell Scripts

Repetitive tasks can be grouped together.

You might be familiar with this due to the concept of "macros" in products like
Microsoft Office and LibreOffice.
