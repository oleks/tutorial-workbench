The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to a philosophy of using the
computer, perhaps different from what you already are familiar with.

This philosophy stands in remembrance of some of the pioneers of modern
operating systems.

The reason that this philosophy is not in wide-spread adoption is perhaps
because the general public disinterest in computer programming.


Later, so-called Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) emerged, the most
popular today being perhaps Eclipse, XCode, and Visual Studio (no marketing
intended).
