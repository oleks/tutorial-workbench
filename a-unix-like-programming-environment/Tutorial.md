# A Unix-like Programming Environment

> Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and
> techniques, no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes

> programs, become general and useful tools.

Brian W. Kernighan & Rob Pike. _The UNIX Programming Environment_. Prentice
Hall, 1984.

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to a philosophy of using the
computer, perhaps different from the one you already are familiar with.

This philosophy stands on the shoulders of some of the pioneers of modern
computer operating systems and programming environments.

The reason that this way of using a computer is not in wide-spread adoption is
sometimes due to:

1. a general public disinterest in computer programming,
2. a fondness of the general public of [graphical user
interfaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), and
3. the resulting sectaraniasm of the who practice what we preach.

This tutorial is close in spirit to the popular book "The UNIX Programming
Environment", by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike, Prentice Hall, 1984. This
tutorial serves perhaps as a modern introduction to the book, should you choose
to read it.

This tutorial is by no means comprehensive, and is not intended as a reference
beyond the philosophical considerations. As you shall see, it is part of the
philosophy that you try to seek reference elsewhere.

## A bit of history

Later, so-called Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) emerged, the most
popular today being perhaps Eclipse, XCode, and Visual Studio (no marketing
intended).
