# A Unix-like Programming Environment

> Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and
> techniques, no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes
> it effective is an approach to programming, a philosophy of using the
> computer. Although that philosophy can't be written down in a single
> sentence, at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from
> the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX
> programs do quite trivial tasks in isolation, but, combined with other
> programs, become general and useful tools.

Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike. _The UNIX Programming Environment_. Prentice
Hall, 1984.

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to a philosophy of using the
computer, perhaps different from what you already are acquainted with.

This philosophy stands on the shoulders of some of the pioneers of modern
computer operating systems and programming environments.

The reason that this way of using a computer is often not in wide-spread
adoption is sometimes due to:

1. a general public disinterest in computer programming,
2. a fondness of the general public of [graphical user
interfaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), and
3. the resulting sectaraniasm of those who practice what we preach.

This tutorial is in close spirit with the popular book "The UNIX Programming
Environment", by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike, Prentice Hall, 1984, and
serves perhaps as a modern introduction to the book, should you choose to read
it.

This tutorial is by no means comprehensive, and is not intended as a reference
beyond the philosophical considerations. As part of the tutorial, we will try
to guide you on where to find further details.

Later, so-called Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) emerged, the most
popular today being perhaps Eclipse, XCode, and Visual Studio (no marketing
intended).

## A Command-Line Shell

The crux of a Unix-like programming environment is a Unix-like command-line
interface with the operating system.

> DEFINITION: A "shell" is a user interface for accessing the services offered
> by an operating system.

### Linux

### Mac OS

### Windows

### Other

If you're using something other than Linux, Mac OS, and Windows on your
personal computer, you should already know how to fire up a terminal.
